# --- Stage 1: The Build Environment ---
# Start with a Node.js image to build our React app.
# We'll name this stage "builder" so we can refer to it later.
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json first
# This takes advantage of Docker caching. If these files don't change,
# Docker won't re-run 'npm install' on every build.
COPY package*.json ./

# Install the project dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application source code
COPY . .

# Run the build script to compile the React app into static files
# The output will be in the /app/build directory.
RUN npm run build

# --- Stage 2: The Production Environment ---
# Now, start a new, lightweight Nginx web server image.
FROM nginx:1.25-alpine

# Copy the final, optimized build files from our "builder" stage
# into the directory that Nginx serves files from.
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80, which is the default port for Nginx
EXPOSE 80

# The default Nginx command will automatically start the server,
# so we don't need a CMD instruction here.
